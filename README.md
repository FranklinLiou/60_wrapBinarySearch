## Recall Inverse Functions and Logarithms
What is meant by:
```
y = log(subscript)2x
```
This equation can also be written as:
```
2^y = x
```
- In the equation, `y` is the number that `2`, the base, must be raised to to get `x`.
- The graph looks like a curve in the first quadrant with an asymtote of `x = 0`. The graph also has an x-intercept of `1` and its rate of change decreases the greater `x` is.
